Hello,
the change I made to the data is reflected in the table called [AbpEntityPropertyChanges], there is no problem here.
But even if I make more than 1 different different update to the same data [AbpEntityPropertyChanges], this table only looks like the update I made first, other updates are not reflected
I would like your help in this matter.
